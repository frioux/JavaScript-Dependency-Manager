=head1 SYNOPSIS

First, annotate your javascript files with C<provides> and/or C<requires>:

 // provides: Ack
 // requires: underscore
 var Ack = _.throttle(function(foo) {
   alert('ACK! ' + foo)
 }, 100)

 // etc, etc

Now you can use C<JavaScript::Dependency::Manager> to automatically create a
list of files needed for a given L</provision>.

 use JavaScript::Dependency::Manager;

 my $mgr = JavaScript::Dependency::Manager->new(
   lib_dir => ['root/js/lib'],
   provisions => {
     underscore => ['root/js/lib/underscore/underscore.js'],
   },
 );

 my @files = $mgr->file_list_for_provisions(['Lynx.ui.form.MWHY']);

Note that I manually set a provision above.  That's because C<underscore> is an
external library, so I shouldn't edit it's source to set it's provisions.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module simply helps you automatically create a list of necessary files
based on a list of "modules", which are merely your way of identifying
functions, objects, classes, or whatever else that you would like to load. It
will correctly order the list of files to load based on your defined
requirements.

=head1 TERMS

=head2 requirement

A C<requirement> is simply a B<module> that a given B<file> needs to run.

=head2 provision

A C<provision> is simply a B<module> that a given B<file> has within it.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 file_list_for_provisions

 my @files = $mgr->file_list_for_provisions(['Foo', 'Bar'])

This method returns a list of files needed to load a list of provisions.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 lib_dir

B<required>.  An C<ArrayRef> of directories to scan to create the list of
L</requirement>s and L</provision>s.

=head2 recurse

B<False> by default.  Set to true if you want the tool to recurse into
subdirectories of the L</lib_dir>.

=head2 scan_files

B<True> by default.  Set to false if you want the tool not to scan files at
all, but instead use a provided list of L</requirement>s and L</provision>s.

=head2 lax

B<False> by default.  Set to true if you want the tool not to die on missing
L</provision>s.

=head1 DEDICATION

C<JavaScript::Dependency::Manager> module is dedicated to my namesake, Arthur
Dale Schmidt.  He was my grandfather as well as the inventor of a chemical
called Sand Control 60 (SC60,) which was used in oil fields to reduce the
need to redrill entire wells due to sand clogging.
